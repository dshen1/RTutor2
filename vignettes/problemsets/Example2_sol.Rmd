Adapt the working directory below and press Ctrl-Alt-R (run all chunks). This creates the problem set files and the sample solution from this solution file.
#< ignore
```{r "Create problem set files"}
library(RTutor2)
setwd("C:/folder_of_this_solution_file")
ps.name = "Example"; sol.file = paste0(ps.name,"_sol.Rmd")
libs = NULL # character vector of all packages you load in the problem set
create.ps(sol.file=sol.file, ps.name=ps.name, user.name=NULL,libs=libs, name.sol.chunks=TRUE)
```

## Exercise 1 -- Summary statistics

#< info "random numbers"
Here are examples for generating random numbers
```{r}
runif(3,0,100)
sample(1:100,5)
```
#>

a) We often want to compute some summary statistic of a vector.
For example:
```{r "1 a) 1"}
#< task
x = 10:20
# Computing the sum of x
sum(x)
#>
```

Now compute the mean of x.
```{r "1 a) 2"}
mean(x)
#< hint
display("There already exist R functions for many things. To find them use Google, e.g. search for 'R compute mean'.")
#>
```

#< award "mean means mean"
Well, in some occasions one can just guess the name of an R function. The function to compute the mean of a vector, or matrix is called 'mean'. Usually, it is much quicker to goggle than to guess function names, however.

## Exercise 2 -- Computing with vectors

```{r}
#< settings
import.var = list("1"="x")
#>
```
a) Let y be a vector that contains the squared elements of x. Show y
```{r "2 a)"}
y = x^2
```
